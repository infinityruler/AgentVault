# INFT Pitch Playbook (Non-Technical Friendly)

Date: February 20, 2026
Project: AgentVault (INFT Agent Marketplace + Leasing)

## One-Line Pitch
AgentVault turns AI agents into tradable, leaseable on-chain assets where ownership transfers the actual encrypted intelligence, not just a collectible token.

## Why This Matters
- Art NFTs proved digital ownership of media.
- INFTs extend that model to functional AI IP.
- This creates a real market for programmable intelligence, not just speculation.

## Problem (Simple Language)
- Today, most AI agents live behind centralized APIs.
- If you "buy" one, you often get marketing rights, not the working intelligence bundle.
- Ownership and usability are disconnected.
- That breaks trust, resale, and financialization.

## Solution (Simple Language)
- Package an AI agent as encrypted metadata.
- Store it in decentralized storage.
- Mint a token that points to that encrypted intelligence.
- On transfer, re-encrypt so only the new owner can use it.
- Allow leasing rights so owners can earn yield without selling.

## What Is New vs Regular NFT
- Regular NFT: ownership of token record and metadata pointer.
- INFT: ownership plus transfer of usable encrypted intelligence and permissioning logic.

## Buzzword Bank You Can Safely Use
- tokenized intelligence

- agent-native liquidity
- permissionless distribution of AI capabilities
- productive digital assets

## 30-Second Pitch
We are building AgentVault, an INFT marketplace where AI agents become real on-chain assets. Traditional NFTs transfer ownership labels, but not working intelligence. We encrypt agent metadata, store it on decentralized storage, and bind it to an INFT. When ownership changes, the intelligence is re-encrypted for the buyer, so transfer is functional, not symbolic. Owners can also lease usage rights to generate yield without selling the agent.

## 90-Second Pitch
The current AI economy has a trust problem: agents are centralized, non-transferable, and hard to monetize transparently. AgentVault solves this by representing each agent as an INFT with encrypted intelligence metadata and on-chain rights management. A creator mints an agent, lists it on marketplace, a buyer purchases it, and transfer logic re-encrypts access for the new owner. We also support leasing, so holders can grant time-boxed usage rights for recurring revenue. This shifts NFTs from static collectibles to productive AI infrastructure and gives us a foundation for AgentFi products like rentals, collateralization, and revenue-sharing vaults.

## Demo Storyboard (3 Minutes)
1. Creator wallet mints agent INFT (show metadata hash + storage root).
2. Creator lists INFT on marketplace.
3. Buyer wallet purchases INFT.
4. Show transfer proof and updated ownership.
5. Buyer leases usage rights to third wallet.
6. Third wallet runs one inference call through authorized execution path.
7. Show on-chain proof trail and rights expiry.

## Judge Questions and Strong Answers
Q: How is this different from a normal NFT marketplace?
A: We transfer encrypted intelligence rights with ownership using ERC-7857-style semantics, not just token metadata pointers.

Q: Why on-chain for this?
A: On-chain gives trust-minimized ownership history, entitlement enforcement, and programmable finance primitives.

Q: What is the real business model?
A: Primary mint fees, secondary trade fees, leasing commissions, and optional protocol fee on agent-generated revenue.

Q: What about security?
A: We keep plaintext off-chain, use encrypted metadata, signature-verified transfer proofs, nonce replay protection, and contract-level access controls.

Q: Why now?
A: AI agents are exploding, but ownership rails are missing. INFT standards and 0G infra now make this buildable.

## What Not To Say
- Do not claim "fully trustless TEE security" unless implemented and audited.
- Do not promise legal IP guarantees beyond technical ownership/rights.
- Do not overpromise DeFi features not in the live demo.

## Confidence Anchors for Pitch
- We prove ownership transfer of usable intelligence access.
- We demonstrate monetization through leasing.
- We show composability path into broader AgentFi.
- We can ship an MVP flow in hackathon timeframe.
