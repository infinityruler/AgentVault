# Pitch Notes

## Core Problem
AI agents are mostly centralized SaaS endpoints. Ownership is unclear and transfer of usable intelligence is not standardized.

## Core Insight
NFT-style ownership needs intelligent transfer semantics. INFT patterns solve this by binding encrypted intelligence metadata + rights to token lifecycle.

## Product
AgentVault: an INFT marketplace where agents are minted, traded, and leased on 0G.

## Why 0G
- 0G Chain: ownership, listing, settlement, entitlements
- 0G Storage: encrypted metadata persistence
- 0G Compute: inference execution path

## Business Model
- Primary mint fee
- Secondary marketplace fee
- Leasing commission

## Security Positioning
- Encrypted metadata, not plaintext on-chain
- Signature-verified transfer proofs with nonce replay protection
- Contract-level owner/approval gating
- API rate limits and bounded payloads

## Future Expansion
- Collateralized agent loans
- Usage-revenue sharing vaults
- Reputation + performance oracle feeds
